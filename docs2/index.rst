Crazyswarm2: A ROS 2 testbed for Aerial Robot Teams
===================================================

Crazyswarm2 is a ROS 2 stack to use aerial robots that use flight computers from Bitcraze AB, including the Crazyflie 2.1(+), Crazyflie 2.1 Brushless, Flapper Nimble+, and custom drones built using Crazyflie Bolt.

On the technical side Crazyswarm2 is a port of the original `Crazyswarm <https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io>`_ to ROS 2.
It is fully open-source (MIT) and available on `github <https://github.com/IMRCLab/crazyswarm2>`_.

A good starting point is the `Aerial Swarm Tools and Applications Tutorial/Workshop <https://imrclab.github.io/workshop-aerial-swarms-rss2024/>`_. If you use our work in academic research, please cite the original paper (we are actively working on a dedicated publication for Crazyswarm2):

.. warning::
  Crazyswarm2 is being actively used and developed. There are currently the following major limitations:
  
  - Crazyradio2 does not perform well when using broadcasts. We recommend using Crazyradio PA instead.
  - Sometimes unicast packets get lost, which is a `known firmware bug <https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/issues/703>`_.
