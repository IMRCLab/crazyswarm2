# Summary

Validation of multi-robot and robot swarm research in the physical world requires a *testbed*, i.e., easily accessible robots and a software stack that is well tested and simplifies the operation of common use cases.
We present Crazyswarm2, a software stack that uses the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) [@ros2] at its core and enables simulation, visualization, and control of commercially off-the-shelf flying robots from Bitcraze AB.
These robots are popular amongst researchers because they are fully open (including schematics and low-level firmware), extendible using standardized connectors, and can be easily obtained world-wide.
Our software made significant changes to Crazyswarm [@crazyswarm], a popular ROS 1-based stack that has been widely used in the research community for planning, state estimation, controls, and even art.
While the high-level API is identical, we used the required breaking changes when moving to ROS 2 to re-visit some core design decisions and enable more sophisticated use-cases compared to the original Crazyswarm.

# Statement of Need

Testbeds are crucial for research in robotics as the simplify and accelerate data collection and validation experiments.
The de-facto standard for physical robots is the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) [@ros2], because robot vendors typically provide drivers and examples using this middleware. 
Most research labs for flying robots either use large custom-built multirotors with a powerful companion computer (e.g., @mrs-uav-system) or the Crazyflie robots by Bitcraze AB.
However, the official vendor software does not have any ROS 2 support and does not scale well to control larger teams of robots.
There are two parallel efforts to mitigate the first issue: CrazyChoir [@crazychoir] and AeroStack2 [@aerostack2]. Both rely on the official Python API, making it difficult to use larger teams, while our default backend is written in C++ and significantly faster. The focus of CrazyChoir is on distributed optimization and for AeroStack2 on high-level missions. In contrast, Crazyswarm2 provides just the essential tools for simulation, visualization and control to allow a wide variety of applications, including applications that require significant low-level firmware changes. Differences between the systems and tutorials were provided at the "Aerial Swarm Tools and Applications" workshop at the Robotics Science and Systems conference [@aerialswarms-workshop].

![Architecture of Crazyswarm2](architecture.png){#architecture-diagram width="100%"}

The architecture of Crazyswarm2 can be found in \autoref{architecture-diagram}. The Crazyflie server is the node that connects the Crazyflies to the ROS 2 framework. It's main components contains the Crazyflie Server, the simulation framework, and a seperate python library that simpliflies the command handling through ROS2

The Crazyflie server receives a list of Crazyflie URIs and ROS server parameters, and it will connect to multiple Crazyflies through multiple Crazyradio PAs. Moreover, this configuration yaml file, will also contain all the logging and parameters that needs to be initialized within the Crazyflie ecosystem. It will then convert those specific logging and parameters to their ROS 2 equivilant and praper them in proper topics and paramter types. 

Moreover, the server also convert any control topics to their Crazyflie framework equivelant through the commander structure, which is used for both the pitch/roll/yaw as velocity/position command for control in real time. Moreover, the Crazyflie's high level commander[REF] framework are accessed through ROS 2 services, which only need to be called upon once and the Crazyflie will execute the command fully onboard. Moreover, services also exist to enable logging/parameters upon run time, as of an emergercy service that will shut down the Crazyflie for safety.

The Crazyflie server relies on 3 different backends: (1) The Crazyflie CPP library, (2) the Crazyflie python libary and (3) the simulation backend. (1) was a c++ based libary that was developed in light of the Crazyswarm(1) project and reimplemented for Crazyswarm2. In time, (2) the crazyflie python library was added and made almost feature compelte with (1). Cflib (Crazyflie Python Library), is the officially maintained communication library by Bitcraze AB, the developers of the Crazyflie.

 The simulation backend acts as a gateway to the hybrid software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation. The hybrid SITL consists of wrappers of the original crazyflie's c-based firmware into Python functions, which can be called from the ROS 2 node. The simulation backen end also has various physics and vizualization sub-backends to choose from. The physics backends consist of various options, like A simple quadcopter dynamics based on the python library numpy and a dynamics libary called Dynobench [REF]. The vizualization backed consist of libraries like the ROS 2 native RVIZ2, or blender for high-level rendering purposes for camera sensing. 

 Finally, the Crazyswarm2 architecture also consists of a seperate ROS 2 package that is a python libary. The main purpose of this libary is to create a simpler interface for the users to control their crazyflies as a layer above the full ROS2 interface. Instead of writing service calls and topic publishers, they can call simple fucntions per Crazyflie entity in this libary, which handles the ROS2 calling on the backend.

# Conclusion and Future Work

# Conflict of Interest

Kimberly N. McGuire started her work on Crazyswarm2 while being employed at Bitcraze AB, Sweden, the vendor of the robots supported in this stack. She is currently an independent roboticist with no financial relationship to Bitcraze AB.

# TODO

- mention crazysim (?) [@crazysim]
- mention our prior survey paper on simulation tools [@aerial-sim-survey]
- create a curated list of users / relevant papers that use Crazyswarm2
- latency measurements or other interesting results for the Design / Implementation Choices?
- add a cool figure
- repo clean-up (docs folder; ros_ws folder)
- add dynamicSwarms
